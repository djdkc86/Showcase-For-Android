        <item>Windows Phone - is a smart phone operating system developed by Microsoft. It is the successor to Windows
            Mobile, although it is incompatible with the earlier platform. With Windows Phone, Microsoft created
            a new user interface, featuring a design language named \"Modern\" (which was formerly known as \"Metro\").
            Unlike its predecessor, it is primarily aimed at the consumer market rather than the enterprise market.
            It was first launched in October 2010 with Windows Phone 7.              <!--
            Windows Phone 8.1, which was released in final
            form to developers on April 14, 2014 and will be pushed out to all phones running Windows Phone 8 over the
            coming months, is the latest release of the operating system

        <item>Android - Android is a mobile operating system (OS) based on the Linux kernel that is currently
            developed by Google. With a user interface based on direct manipulation, Android is designed primarily
            for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablet computers, with specialized user interfaces
            for televisions (Android TV), cars (Android Auto), and wrist watches (Android Wear). The OS uses touch
            inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, tapping, pinching, and reverse pinching
            to manipulate on-screen objects, and a virtual keyboard.            <!--
            Despite being primarily designed for touchscreen
            input, it also has been used in game consoles, digital cameras, and other electronics.
            As of 2011, Android has the largest installed base of any mobile OS and as of 2013, its devices also sell
            more than Windows, iOS, and Mac OS devices combined.

        <item>iPhone - iPhone is a line of smart phones designed and marketed by Apple Inc.
            It runs Apple\'s iOS mobile operating system.  The first generation iPhone was released on June 29,
            2007; the most recent iPhones, the seventh-generation iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, were introduced on
            September 10, 2013.  The user interface is built around the device\'s multi-touch screen, including a
            virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and can connect to            <!--
            many different cellular networks, including
            1xRTT (represented by a 1x on the status bar) and GPRS (shown as GPRS on the status bar), EDGE (shown
            as a capital E on the status bar), UMTS and EV-DO (shown as 3G), a faster version of UMTS and 4G (shown
