Android application for displaying activities for ActivityRez, a company based in Honolulu Hawaii.
The application was authored by Nathan Marder in 2014. This was the author's VERY first Android application, 
so there may be more efficient methods for accomplishing some of the desired functions. The application author, 
Nathan Marder, was a computer science student at Hawaii Pacific University while he worked on this project, 
which was itself a summer internship. For Information About ActivityRez go to: http://www.activityrez.com

Features:
Begins with a splash screen that asynchronously calls for API data from ActivityRez servers.  There are listviews,
horizontal swipes, full page swipes, vertical swipes, and image galleries galore.  

Library Dependency: 
Android-Universal-Image-Loader (https://github.com/nostra13/Android-Universal-Image-Loader)
